# Arduino code for ZeDMD

Here is the full code to inject to the ESP32 to control the ZeDMD.
Sorry, it is not commented, but I can give any information requested.

* For the full installation of the ZeDMD, I strongly recommend you to follow the tuto here https://www.pincabpassion.net/t14796-tuto-zepindmd-installation-english .
There have been problems to directly inject the C code via the Arduino IDE, so using the BIN provided in the tuto is the solution to be sure that it'll work.
