# PinDMD3 library for .NET

*Provides a clean API for accessing PinDMD through .NET*

## Features

The idea is to provide a convenient way of sending stuff to the display. This 
library should be able to accept any type of image or video to render. It
should be fast and not use too much resources.

In a second step, processing options might be added, such as resizing and
flipping data before sending it to the display

## Status

Very much work in progress
